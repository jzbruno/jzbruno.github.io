## Experience

### Charter Communications : Lead Software Engineer : Jan. 2018 - Present

Managed a team of engineers tasked with identifying AWS dependencies for existing applications. 
Automated and deployed a subset of those applications into Azure providing a better understanding of
work required to create a more cloud agnostic posture.

AWS, Azure, Helm, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Bash

* Identified AWS services used by existing microservices and researched equivalent Azure services 
ensuring a focus on services that were used the most.
* Researched cloud agnostic solutions for AWS services like S3, Lambda, SNS, and SQS and created 
examples of existing applications using cloud agnostic solutions like Minio and OpenFaaS.
* Developed automation to deploy existing applications into Azure leading to faster deployment, 
debugging, and reproducibility for proof of concept exercises.
* Performed code review and set standards for all automation and documentation.
* Identified issues with deploying existing applications into Azure and created change tickets to 
update applications helping to create a more cloud agnostic posture.
* Generalized and documented changes help other teams in our organization identify potential issues
with their applications.
* Planned, organized, and created detailed stories to ensure all team members were clear on 
current priorities.
* Mentored junior engineers to ensure all team members were able to contribute and grow their skills.

### Charter Communications : Mentor : Apr. 2018 - Aug. 2018

Mentored a college summer intern on end to end software and platform engineering including Agile 
processes, development, and deployment.

### Charter Communications : Sr. Software Engineer : Apr. 2017 - Jan. 2017

Helped design and develop tools to support disaster recovery for existing AWS infrastructure and 
microservice applications. Automated import of AWS infrastructure into Terraform. Developed Go CLI 
tools to backup and sync infrastructure and data between active and passive AWS accounts. Performed 
team lead responsibilities late in the project.

AWS, Go, Terraform, Bash

* Developed Bash scripts and Go CLI tools to import existing AWS resources into Terraform state and
generate Terraform config. Allowed manually created resources to be managed, versioned, and reviewd
by an automated infrastructure as code process.
* Developed Go CLI tools and services to cleanup un-used and old AWS resources helping to reduce 
AWS spend.
* Developed Go CLI tools and services to backup and sync existing AWS resources between active and 
passive accounts.
* Developed a process using AWS DMS to actively sync RDS and Aurora databases between active and 
passive accounts.
* Performed code review for Go CLI tools.
* Performed code review for a Go deployment tool that supported legacy Netflix Asgard / AMI based 
applications and Kubernetes containerized applications.
* Managed an offshore QA team testing and developing automated tests for the disaster recovery tools.

### ProKarma : Sr. Software Developer : Dec. 2015 - Apr. 2017

Designed and developed a release automation platform including a REST API and web UI to replace an 
existing manual microservice deploy process. Parallelized release of large groups of microservices 
and configuration as a single release manifest that could be tracked and easily handle rollbacks.

AWS, Python, Celery, MongoDB, Netflix OSS, Asgard, Nexus, Jenkins, Crowd

* Integrated Netflix Asgard, Nexus, Jenkins, Crowd, and custom configuration management to provide a
single deploy process and management interface.
* Supported parallel deployment of release artifacts.
* Handled integration failures and implemented retries where appropriate.
* Supported easy rollback of failed releases.
* Tracked releases for auditing.
* Decreased release time and manual errors.

### Pearson : Sr. Systems Developer : Dec. 2012 - Dec. 2015

Designed and developed a cloud agnostic IaaS for self service deployment of AWS and VMWare resources 
by development teams. The platform supported 70+ teams and 5000+ virtual instances across 
pre-production and production environments. Configuration of compute resources was controlled by 
Puppet allowing our team to reliably patch the Heartbleed vulnerability on 5000+ instances in a 
couple of days instead of weeks or months.

AWS, Python, Celery, MongoDB, AngularJS 1.x, Twitter Bootstrap 2.x, Puppet, VMWare vCD

* Helped design and develop RESTful API to allow external teams to automated deployments.
* Implemented support for AWS EC2 instances, ELBs, and Route53 DNS.
* Designed and developed AngularJS 1.x web UI.
* Managed an offshore team continuing development of the web UI.
* Implemented support for VMWare VMs and networking using vCD APIs.
* Wrote custom functions for Puppet used for automated system configuration.

### Pearson : Sr. Systems Integration Engineer : Jul. 2012 - Dec. 2012

Developed and supported tools for monitoring 80+ applications including a highly trafficked and 
highly available Learning Management System for online learning. Created a framework for using 
Selenium test cases as synthetic user monitors.

AngularJS 1.x, Selenium, Java, RightScale, AWS

* Developed initial Selenium based monitors.
* Developed a web application using AngularJS for visualizing state of monitors.
* Deployed across three regions for fault tolerance and data collection.
* Automated the deployment of infrastructure using RightScale.
* Documented use of the framework and provided training for NOC engineers and developers.

### eCollege : Systems Integration Engineer II : Sep. 2010 - Jul. 2012

Designed and developed tools for monitoring a highly trafficked and highly available Learning 
Management System for online learning. Gave visibility into 60+ clustered services on 100+ servers
helping reduce incidents due to service availability and capacity.

IIS, ASP.NET MVC, C#, MS SQL Server, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Syslog, MySQL

* Developed an ASP.NET MVC C# web application giving a single pane of glass for services running in
the environment. 
* Deployed the application as a highly available cluster to ensure operations always had access
even during releases.
* Developed algorithm to parse a large number of noisy application logs for anomalies in application 
error counts allowing early detection of failing servers in a cluster.

### eCollege : Systems Integration Engineer I : Apr. 2008 - Sep. 2010

Implemented and maintained application monitoring providing visibility into failing services and 
allowing quick resolution of issues.

### Security with Advanced Technology : Expert Consultant : May 2007 - Nov. 2007

Consulted on a project involving projectile physics. Worked with ballistics, designed and built 
apparatus to collect data, worked with video and still cameras, and performed video editing. 
Completed analysis on collected data.
