## Experience

### Charter Communications : Lead Software Engineer : Jan. 2018 - Present

Managed a team of engineers tasked with identifying AWS dependencies for existing applications and deploying a subset of those applications to Azure.

Helm, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Bash, Azure, AWS, Netflix OSS

* Identified AWS services used by existing microservices and researched equivalent Azure services. This ensured a focus on the services that made the most impact to the company.
* Researched cloud agnostic solutions for AWS services like S3, Lambda, SNS, and SQS. This helps us understand areas that maybe brittle for workload deployments and helps us break ties to a single provider.
* Developed automation to deploy existing applications into Azure using Bash, Terraform, Kubernetes, and Helm. This led to faster deployment, faster debugging, and reproducibility for the proof of concept exercises.
* Identified issues with deploying existing applications into Azure and created change tickets to update the applications where necessary. This helps prepare us in the event that a migration is required.
* Documented changes to make our organization less dependent on AWS which helped other teams identify issues with their applications.

### Charter Communications : Mentor : Apr. 2018 - Aug. 2018

Mentored a college intern on end to end software and platform engineering. This included Agile processes, development, and deployment.

### Charter Communications : Sr. Software Engineer : Apr. 2017 - Jan. 2017

Helped design and develop tools to support disaster recovery for existing AWS infrastructure and microservice applications. Acted as team lead later in the project.

Bash, Terraform, Go, AWS (S3, EC2, IAM, RDS)

* Implemented tools to create Terraform config based on existing AWS resources. Allowed us to bring previously un-automated resources under control as infrastructure as code.
* Implemented cleanup tools to remove old resources helping to drive down AWS cost.
* Implemented tools to sync resources between active and passive accounts.
* Implemented tools to sync data between active and passive accounts.
* Managed work on deployment tool to replace Asgard and Kubernetes in an abstracted way.

### ProKarma : Sr. Software Developer : Dec. 2015 - Apr. 2017

Designed and developed a release automation and orchestration REST API and web UI.

Python, Celery, MongoDB, Netflix OSS, Asgard, Nexus, Jenkins, Crowd

* Integrated with Netflix Asgard, Nexus, Jenkins, Crowd, and custom configuration stores.
* Supported parallel deployment of release artifacts.
* Handled integration failures and implemented retries where appropriate.
* Tracked releases for auditing.

### Pearson : Sr. Systems Developer : Dec. 2012 - Dec. 2015

Designed and developed a cloud agnostic REST API for deploying infrastructure.

Python, Celery, MongoDB, AngularJS 1.x, Twitter Bootstrap, Puppet, AWS, VMWare vCD

* Supported 70+ teams and 5000+ virtual instances across pre-production and production environments.
* Provisioned infrastructure on AWS and VMWare vCD.
* Allowed push button deploys for database clusters, load balancers, and web servers.
* Automated system configuration with Puppet.

Designed and developed the UI for the REST API using AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap. Managed an offshore team that continued development of the UI. Provided architecture direction, mentorship, and code review. See less

### Pearson : Sr. Systems Integration Engineer : Jul. 2012 - Dec. 2012

Developed and supported tools for monitoring 80+ applications including a highly trafficked and highly available Learning Management System for online learning.

AngularJS 1.x, Selenium, Java, RightScale, AWS

Developed a framework for using Selenium test cases as synthetic user monitors.

* Developed a web application using AngularJS for visualizing state of monitors.
* Deployed across three regions for fault tolerance and data collection.
* Automated the deployment of infrastructure using RightScale.
* Documented use of the framework and provided training for NOC engineers and developers.

### eCollege : Systems Integration Engineer II : Sep. 2010 - Jul. 2012

Developed and supported tools for monitoring a highly trafficked and highly available Learning Management System for online learning.

IIS, ASP.NET MVC, C#, MS SQL Server, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Syslog, MySQL

* Developed a web application that gave operations teamsâ€™ visibility into 60+ clustered services on 100+ servers. Helped reduce incidents due to service availability and capacity. Enabled management of servers for maintenance and application deployment.
* Developed algorithm to parse noisy application logs for anomalies in application error counts. Allowed detection of bad servers in a cluster from millions of log entries an hour. 

### eCollege : Systems Integration Engineer I : Apr. 2008 - Sep. 2010

Implemented and maintained application monitoring providing visibility into failing services and allowing quick resolution of issues.

### Security with Advanced Technology : Expert Consultant : May 2007 - Nov. 2007
